  # change:
  #
  # * Change the code lists to the ones for the new version
  # * Change the stored version number to the new version

  # N.b.: using this migration for a pair of versions is a claim that there are
  # NO semantic modifications of specified values between them. DO NOT use it
  # for any pair of versions without rigorously verifying that this is the case.

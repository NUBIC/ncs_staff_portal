    # The objects registered here migrate Ops from one MDES version to the
    # an adjacent one. Each migration object must implement three methods:
    #
    # - #run: the method that actually performs the migration. It must do
    #   everything that's required to safely change Ops from one version to
    #   the next. In addition to whatever version-specific migrations are
    #   required, this includes changing the stored MDES version value and
    #   updating the code lists.
    # - #from: the version this migration expects Ops to be in before it
    #   starts executing.
    # - #to: the version this migration will leave Ops in after #run is complete.

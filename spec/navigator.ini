# A pointer to a CSV describing the sampling units for this study
# center.  If the path is not absolute it will be resolved relative to
# this file.
#
# The CSV must have the following header (along with the contents it
# implies):
#
#   PSU_ID, AREA, SSU_ID, SSU_NAME, TSU_ID, TSU_NAME
#
# While this format allows for multiple PSUs, NCS Navigator currently
# only supports one per deployment. This will change in the future
# when multiple PSUs are active per center.
#
# TSU_ID and TSU_NAME may be omitted for centers that are not on
# Hi-Lo.
#
# AREA is an intermediate concept introduced by NCS Navigator. It
# allows the grouping of one or more SSUs for ease of reporting
# something (e.g., outreach events) across all of them. If a center
# doesn't wish to make use of this concept, the AREA should be made
# the same as the SSU_NAME.
